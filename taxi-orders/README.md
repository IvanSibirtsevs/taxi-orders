# Forecasting taxi orders


# Description of the project

*The Clear Taxi Company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.
The value of the RMSE metric on the test sample should not exceed 48.*


***Project steps***
- Loading data and performing their resampling for one hour.
- Data analysis.
- Training different models with different hyperparameters.
- Verification of data on a test sample and conclusions.

***Data Description***
- The number of orders is in the 'num_orders' column.
